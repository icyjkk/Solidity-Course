# Simple-storage
My first solidity project.

Basically it stores numbers and people with their favorite numbers and displays them.

It is made to understand how variables, functions, their types...etc work.

This is part of the [Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ&t=7352s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

## Getting Started

1. Go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Paste the code from `SimpleStorage.sol` into a new file in Remix
3. Hit `Compile`
4. Hit `Deploy`

## Thank you!
